To build CWM recovery here are the steps:
========================================

$ make -j4 otatools

$ . buid/envsetup.sh

$ lunch cm_a57-eng

$ make -j4 recoveryimage

=======================================

If you flash the recovery you will face black screen.. dont panic , its because of brightness problem.. to enable brightness permanently| unpack your builded recovery and  place "qrdsys.sh" in /ramdisk/sbin/<here> & add the following lines in init.rc 

"service qrdtrd /sbin/sh /sbin/qrdsys.sh
    oneshot"

repack and flash viola brightness is enabled :P
